# Cluster Application and Platform Guide

This document explains what the live `k8s-homelab-2` cluster is doing, based on the GitOps repo and the live pod/service/PVC snapshot you provided.

It is organized from platform foundations to user-facing apps so a reader can understand dependencies as they go.

## Scope and assumptions

- Cluster shape: 3-node highly available control plane (`balthasar-2`, `casper-3`, `melchior-1`), all currently `Ready` on Kubernetes `v1.35.1`.
- GitOps model: Argo CD `root` app syncs `cluster/platform/gitops/argocd`, which then syncs platform and app `Application` objects.
- This guide focuses on active/intended functionality and ignores leftover migration/iteration artifacts as requested.

## 1) Core platform foundation

### Kubernetes and GitOps

- Kubernetes control plane components (API server, scheduler, controller-manager, etcd) run on all 3 nodes.
- Argo CD is the deployment orchestrator for almost everything in this repo.
- Argo app-of-apps pattern is used: one root app fans out into many platform and workload apps.
- Namespaces are pre-created for logical separation: `ai`, `media`, `productivity`, `other`, `web`, plus platform namespaces like `security`, `service-mesh`, `rook-ceph`, `databases`, `backup`, and others.

### Cluster networking: Cilium + Hubble

- Cilium is the CNI and datapath (including kube-proxy replacement) for pod/service networking.
- Hubble Relay/UI are enabled for network flow visibility.
- Cilium is treated as day-0/bootstrap infrastructure (manual runbook-driven) rather than Argo-managed.

### North-south networking: MetalLB + HAProxy Ingress

- MetalLB advertises service IPs on LAN via L2.
- IP pool: `192.168.1.230-192.168.1.250` on interface `enp196s0`.
- HAProxy Ingress is the HTTP/HTTPS entrypoint, exposed via MetalLB at `192.168.1.230`.
- Two ingress classes are defined:
- `haproxy` (default/public-facing style)
- `haproxy-restricted` (used for internal/restricted apps, often with source allowlists)
- Shared ingress manifests route many hostnames to internal services (for example `chat.rcrumana.xyz`, `nextcloud.rcrumana.xyz`, `qbit.rcrumana.xyz`, `ceph.rcrumana.xyz`, `argocd.rcrumana.xyz`, etc.).

### TLS automation: cert-manager

- cert-manager is installed with HA replicas.
- Let’s Encrypt ClusterIssuers exist for staging and production, using Cloudflare DNS-01.
- A wildcard certificate for `*.k8s.rcrumana.xyz` is issued for ingress default TLS usage.

### Service mesh: Linkerd

- Linkerd is installed as multiple coordinated apps:
- CRDs, CNI plugin, control plane, identity/cert resources, and viz components.
- Linkerd CNI is used to avoid privileged init containers in meshed workloads.
- Linkerd identity and webhook certs are managed with cert-manager, with trust anchor material sourced via External Secrets.

### Traffic control and scheduling helpers

- `egress-qos` daemonset runs on each node and uses `tc`/iptables/ipset to shape egress for pods labeled `traffic-tier=bulk-seed`.
- This is specifically relevant to high-bandwidth torrent workloads in media stacks.
- Descheduler is installed as a periodic CronJob to rebalance/evict under policy constraints.

## 2) Security and secrets foundation

### Vault

- HashiCorp Vault runs as a 3-node HA Raft cluster in `security`.
- Vault storage is on Ceph (`ceph-block`, 10Gi per Vault pod).
- Vault UI is enabled (cluster-internal service; external access is typically through ingress or internal networking controls).

### External Secrets

- External Secrets Operator is installed in HA mode.
- `ClusterSecretStore` named `vault` points ESO to Vault (`http://vault.security.svc:8200`, KV v2).
- Most app credentials are not in Git; they are pulled from Vault and materialized as Kubernetes Secrets.

## 3) Storage, snapshots, and backups

### Primary storage: Rook/Ceph

- Rook operator is installed via Helm, then a Ceph cluster is defined via manifests.
- Ceph cluster is 3-mon / 2-mgr with OSDs spread across all 3 nodes (two NVMe devices per node are configured).
- Ceph networking is host-network based with:
- Public network: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Cluster/replication network: `172.16.100.0/24`
- Core storage interfaces exposed to Kubernetes:
- `ceph-block` (default StorageClass, RBD, RWO volumes)
- `ceph-filesystem` (CephFS, RWX volumes)
- Ceph dashboard is enabled and exposed via ingress (`ceph.rcrumana.xyz`).

### Volume snapshots

- CSI snapshot controller is installed.
- Default `VolumeSnapshotClass` is `ceph-block-snap` (RBD snapshots).

### Object storage endpoint for backups

- `other/minio` in this repo is a Kubernetes Service/Endpoints bridge to an external MinIO instance at `192.168.1.10`.
- Two internal services are provided:
- `minio` (console-style endpoint on 9002)
- `minio-api` (S3 API endpoint on 9000)
- Both are also published through restricted ingresses.

### Backup engines

- VolSync is installed in `backup`.
- VolSync replication sources are declared for `media`, `productivity`, and `other` namespaces.
- Pattern used:
- Snapshot-based copy from Ceph PVCs (`copyMethod: Snapshot`, `ceph-block-snap`)
- Restic repository stored in MinIO (credentials pulled from Vault)
- Retention profile is typically daily/weekly/monthly.
- CloudNativePG clusters also run scheduled backups to MinIO (`s3://cluster-backups/cnpg/...`) with 30-day retention.

## 4) Shared data platforms

### PostgreSQL platform (CloudNativePG)

- CNPG operator runs in `cnpg-system`.
- Five shared PostgreSQL clusters run in `databases` (all 3-instance HA):
- `pg-platform` (platform services)
- `pg-media` (media services)
- `pg-ai` (AI services)
- `pg-productivity` (productivity services)
- `pg-other` (other services)
- Each cluster provides read-write and read-only services (`*-rw`, `*-ro`, `*-r`).
- Persistent storage for all CNPG clusters uses Ceph block volumes.

### Redis platform (Redis Enterprise)

- Redis Enterprise operator is installed in `databases`.
- `RedisEnterpriseCluster` named `rec-platform` runs 3 nodes with Ceph-backed persistence.
- Two managed Redis databases are defined:
- `redis-cache` (cache semantics, LRU eviction)
- `redis-queue` (queue semantics, persistence enabled)

## 5) Workloads by namespace

## `ai` namespace

### LibreChat stack

- Main web app: `librechat` deployment and service.
- Embedded support services inside same namespace:
- MongoDB (`librechat-mongodb` statefulset)
- Meilisearch (`librechat-meilisearch` statefulset)
- RAG API (`librechat-rag-api` deployment, 2 replicas)
- Core behavior:
- User chat UI/API is served by LibreChat.
- RAG API uses `pg-ai-rw` (pgvector-style backend) and Redis.
- LLM calls are routed to local `llm-gateway` (in-cluster OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
- External access is via ingress at `chat.rcrumana.xyz`.
- Persistent data uses Ceph PVCs (`librechat-data`, Mongo data, Meilisearch data).

### Llama backend + gateway

- Three model-serving workers:
- `llama-static-a`
- `llama-static-b`
- `llama-swap` (dynamic model swap service)
- Front door for AI clients is `llm-gateway` (LiteLLM), exposed as cluster service `llm-gateway:4000`.
- Workers use AMD GPU resources (`amd.com/gpu`) and shared RWX model cache PVC (`llama-models-cache`, `ceph-filesystem`, 500Gi).
- Model artifacts are fetched/seeded from Hugging Face in init containers, using Vault-sourced tokens.
- This backend is consumed by LibreChat and can be consumed by other internal clients through OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## `media` namespace

### ARR ecosystem (arr, arr-lts, arr-lts2)

- There are three qBittorrent stacks in media:
- `arr-stack` (full media automation suite)
- `arr-lts` (qBittorrent + Gluetun)
- `arr-lts2` (qBittorrent + Gluetun)
- All three route qBittorrent traffic through a colocated Gluetun VPN container.
- Each stack also includes a `pf-sync` sidecar that continuously applies VPN-forwarded port changes into qBittorrent WebUI settings.
- `arr-stack` includes these additional services in one pod:
- `sonarr`, `radarr`, `lidarr`, `prowlarr`, `jellyseerr`, `flaresolverr`
- `arr-stack` also includes bootstrap logic to write Servarr PostgreSQL settings into config files.
- PostgreSQL dependency for media automation is `pg-media-rw` (for Servarr/Jellyseerr DBs).
- Media files are mounted from node host path `/NAS`; app configs are on Ceph PVCs.
